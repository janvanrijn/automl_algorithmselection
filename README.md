# Algorithm Selection

In this assignment, we will implement algorithm selection model for Machine Learning
algorithms. 
Formally, the task is to select the best algorithm $\algo$ from a portfolio of
algorithms $P$ for a given dataset $x$ with respect to a performance
metric $m$ (in this case: accuracy).
